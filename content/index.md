**Hi guys! I'm a young Front-End Web Developer and a Wordpress expert.**

I love clean and optimized code, fast and modern UI and team work.
I've been working for 6 years for some Milan-based web agency developing website, web-app and wordpress themes.

I am very comfortable coding with HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP, Wordpress, NodeJS, python, front-end frameworks and JS libraries and frameworks.
My past experience in close contact with clients granted me the knowledge and the capacity to build and manage customers' whole web presence, such as branding, site information architecture, seo, sem, social networking, analytics and **everything else you can think of.**
